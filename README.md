# Basketball Player Stats Analyzer

## Overview

As a software engineer aiming to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge, I developed this program to analyze basketball player statistics. My primary goal in creating this software is to practice data processing techniques, handling CSV files, and implementing basic comparison functionalities.

# Data Set Description

The data set comprises various statistics of basketball players, including points, assists, rebounds, and field goal percentage, categorized by different metrics such as per 36 minutes, per game, and total. The data was collected from Basketball Reference, a comprehensive basketball statistics database.

# Purpose

The purpose of this software is to allow users to compare the performance of two basketball players based on selected statistical metrics. Users can input the names of the players they wish to compare along with the type of statistics (per 36 minutes, per game, or total), and the program will display a comparison of the specified statistics for the two players.
